# PlayerExperience2019
Digital game project for Northeastern GSND Player Experience course, Fall 2019.

## Home Alone: A Pet-Life Simulator
A top-down pet simulation game where the player is tasked with ensuring the survival of a pet cat during an 8 hour work day.

This repository chronicles the process for creating this game, as well as the most current build as of the final due date for this project.

In my spare time I am continuing to work on this game, replacing art assets found online with original creations, creating a progression system, upgrading the UI, etc. Also working on building a webGL version. Stay tuned for updates :)

## Installation/Running Instructions
1. Navigate to 'Builds' folder --> download entire folder
2. Inside folder, open HomeAlone.exe to run the game
